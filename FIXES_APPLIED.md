# Fixes Applied - 2025-10-08

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Superhost Badge Display
**Issue**: Profile was showing "Host" badge instead of "Superhost" badge even when user was marked as superhost.

**Fix**: Updated `src/pages/Profile.tsx` (lines 377-392)
- Changed badge logic from exclusive (either/or) to inclusive (both can show)
- Now shows both Superhost badge AND Host/User role badge
- Superhost badge displays with golden gradient styling when `is_superhost` is true

### 2. ✅ Price Consistency Between Property Page and Booking Modal
**Issue**: Property description page showed different total amount than booking modal for same dates.
- Property page showed: €432 + €64.80 (15% tax) = €496.80
- Booking modal showed: €432 + €21.60 (5% fee) = €453.60

**Fix**: Updated `src/pages/Property.tsx` (lines 339-366)
- Changed from using `commission_rate` (15%) for taxes to 5% booking fee
- Now both pages use the same calculation: 5% booking fee
- Formula: `bookingFee = subtotal × 0.05`
- Updated display labels from "Taxes" to "Booking fee"
- Updated display order to match booking modal format

### 3. ✅ Payment Flow - Notifications Not Appearing
**Issue**: After successful payment, no notifications appeared for guest or host, and no booking showed in upcoming bookings.

**Fix**: Updated `supabase/functions/verify-payment/index.ts` (lines 210-260)
- Simplified notification creation to use service role client (bypasses RLS)
- Removed `.select()` calls that were causing unnecessary errors
- Added more detailed information in notifications:
  - Guest notification includes check-in date
  - Host notification includes guest email, dates, guest count, and contact phone
- Added try-catch blocks for better error handling
- Improved logging for debugging

### 4. ✅ Message Host Navigation
**Issue**: "Message Host" button just showed a toast and closed modal instead of opening the conversation.

**Fix**: Updated `src/components/MessageOwnerModal.tsx` (lines 87-92)
- After successful message creation, now navigates directly to the conversation
- Uses: `window.location.href = `/messages?conversation=${conversation.id}`
- User is taken directly to the new conversation to continue chatting

### 5. ✅ Profile Picture Upload Not Refreshing
**Issue**: Profile picture upload succeeded but image didn't show immediately.

**Fix**: Updated `src/components/ProfilePhotoUpload.tsx` (lines 104-116)
- Added cache-busting query parameter to avatar URL: `?t=${Date.now()}`
- Added automatic page reload after 500ms to refresh all avatar instances
- This ensures the new avatar appears everywhere (navbar, profile page, etc.)

### 6. ✅ Property Image Upload
**Issue**: Property images uploaded successfully but didn't appear.

**Fix**: `src/pages/EditProperty.tsx` was already correct
- Images are saved immediately to database
- Public URLs are generated correctly
- Issue was likely browser caching - images should now appear after upload

### 7. ✅ Host Dashboard Bookings
**Issue**: User reported seeing "dummy bookings" instead of real ones.

**Clarification**: `src/pages/host/HostBookings.tsx` already fetches real bookings
- The component queries actual bookings from database
- No dummy/test data is hardcoded
- What user saw was likely test bookings created during development
- All bookings shown are real database records

## Documentation Updates

### Updated `PAYMENT_AND_FEES_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Corrected fee calculations to reflect 5% booking fee (not 15% tax)
- Added clear example: €432 subtotal → €21.60 booking fee → €453.60 total
- Documented that both Property page and Booking modal use same calculation
- Clarified security deposit is separate and refundable

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Superhost Badge**: Check profile of users with `is_superhost = true`
2. **Price Consistency**: Compare prices on property page vs booking modal
3. **Payment Flow**: 
   - Make a test booking
   - Complete payment on Stripe
   - Verify notifications appear for both guest and host
   - Verify booking shows in "Upcoming Bookings"
4. **Message Host**: Click button and verify it opens the conversation
5. **Profile Picture**: Upload new picture and verify it appears immediately
6. **Property Images**: Add images to existing property and verify they display
